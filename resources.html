  <h2 class="section-title">Sketching Tools We Recommend</h2>
  <p>While students can use any basic tools, we recommend the following to improve precision and consistency:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>✏️ HB or 2B pencils (smooth strokes, easy to erase)</li>
    <li>📏 Rulers (for margin and box setup)</li>
    <li>🧼 White erasers (non-smudging)</li>
    <li>🖼️ Sketch Boards (flat, hard surface with clip)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="section-title">Tips for Better Sketching</h2>
  <ul class="tip-list">

    <li>Use boxes and lines until your strokes are consistent</li>
    <li>Erase gently to avoid tearing the paper</li>
    <li>Sketch slowly — speed comes after control</li>

  <h2 class="section-title">Deeper Benefits of Letter Sketching</h2>
  <p>Sketching isn't just a subject — it's a slow art form that changes the student's mindset. At JPPS, we’ve observed how daily letter sketching improves not only handwriting but also **emotions, behavior, and inner calmness**.</p>

  <ul class="benefit-list">
    <li>🧠 <strong>Mental Clarity:</strong> Sketching sharp letters helps students declutter their thoughts. Each stroke requires focus, which clears mental noise and brings the mind to the present moment.</li>

    <li>✋ <strong>Hand-Brain Harmony:</strong> Repetitive lines and curves connect muscle memory with thought flow. Over time, students feel more “connected” to their handwork and feel confident with paper-based tasks.</li>

    <li>🎵 <strong>Mood Balance:</strong> Sketching with soft pressure and steady rhythm works like meditation. Students who sketch regularly often become calmer, less restless, and more emotionally stable.</li>

    <li>🎨 <strong>Creative Inspiration:</strong> As students master letters, they often begin imagining designs, logos, or visual styles around alphabets. Sketching opens a door to artistic ideas — even for those who don't paint.</li>

    <li>🌱 <strong>Growth Mindset:</strong> Students can see progress in their own work every week. This visible improvement builds confidence and makes them believe in small efforts creating big results.</li>

    <li>💡 <strong>Emotional Expression:</strong> Some students sketch with bold lines, others with light strokes — sketching becomes a quiet way to express their personality and emotions without needing words.</li>

    <li>🧘 <strong>Stress Relief:</strong> When upset or overthinking, sketching provides a peaceful escape. Instead of phone screens, students use pencil and paper to return to a calm, centered mood.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>That’s why we say: at JPPS, sketching is not a hobby. It’s a form of therapy, focus training, and self-respect — taught line by line.</p>
