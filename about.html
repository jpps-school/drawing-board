  <h2 class="section-title">What is the JPPS Drawing Board?</h2>
  <p>The <strong>JPPS Drawing Board</strong> is a digital platform that showcases our students' sketching progress in <strong>English and Hindi letter sketching</strong> — our most vital subject. We don’t do art for decoration — we do sketching for discipline, clarity, and growth.</p>
</section>


<section class="about-section">
  <h2 class="section-title">Why Letters, Not Art?</h2>
  <p>At JPPS, we believe **beauty lies in control**, not color. While most schools encourage children to randomly color shapes or animals, we guide our students to master the basics — straight lines, curved arcs, balanced loops — the true foundation of artistic expression.</p>
  <p>Letters are everywhere — in names, boards, exams, even signatures. That’s why we focus our training on shaping alphabets with rhythm and consistency. Our sketching builds handwriting quality, layout understanding, and structured form — all without needing a paintbrush.</p>
</section>

<section class="about-section">
  <h2 class="section-title">Why This Website?</h2>
  <p>This site was created to preserve and present the real sketching journey of our students — from first strokes to final layouts. Here, parents and teachers can watch progress happen line by line.</p>
</section>

<section class="about-section">
  <h2 class="section-title">How Student Sketches Are Displayed</h2>
  <p>Every student submits their best sketches during practice sessions. Selected sketch pages are scanned and published on this site. We arrange them by class, subject (English or Hindi), and date — to help students, teachers, and parents track growth over time.</p>
  <p>This digital board gives students a real sense of pride and helps us celebrate steady improvement — not just final perfection.</p>

<section class="about-section">
  <h2 class="section-title">Our Sketching Style</h2>
  <ol class="steps-list">
    <li><strong>1. Trace:</strong> Students begin by tracing lined letters.</li>
    <li><strong>2. Repeat:</strong> Repetition sketching for accuracy.</li>
    <li><strong>3. Space Control:</strong> Sketching with box guidance to learn spacing.</li>
    <li><strong>4. Final Sketch:</strong> Freehand balanced letters without tracing.</li>
  </ol>
</section>

<section class="about-section">
  <h2 class="section-title">Letter Sketching is a Skill</h2>
  <p>Sketching letters isn’t easy. It requires attention, patience, and rhythm. Our students learn to treat each curve and corner as meaningful — not rushed. Over time, this practice improves not just their handwriting but also their ability to concentrate and organize thoughts.</p>
  <p>That’s why we call it a skill — not just a subject.</p>
</section>

<section class="about-section mentor-section">
  <h2 class="section-title">Who Built This?</h2>
  <p>This site is inspired by our sketching mentor <strong>Zafar Sanu</strong> — an artist with extraordinary skill in both structured sketching and soulful singing. His eye for form, balance, and detail has shaped generations of students.</p>
